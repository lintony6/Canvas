## Technical Details
- **Layered Canvases**:
  - `bgCanvas`: Static background image or white fill (z-index: 1).
  - `drawingCanvas`: User drawings (z-index: 2).
  - Eraser uses `destination-out` on `drawingCanvas` to reveal `bgCanvas`.
- **State**:
  - `strokes` array stores actions for replay/undo.
  - `undoStack`/`redoStack` for snapshots (max 50).
- **Events**: Pointer Events for mouse/touch compatibility.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `setCanvasSize`: Resizes canvases.
  - `beginStroke`/`continueStroke`/`endStroke`: Freehand drawing/erasing.
  - `drawShapePreview`/`commitShape`: Shape drawing with previews.
  - `placeTextAt`: Text input.
  - `floodFill`: Stack-based fill.
  - `setBackgroundImage`: Loads background to `bgCanvas`.
  - `replayTimelapse`: Animates drawing process.

## Known Issues
- Large canvases/many strokes may slow replay on low-end devices.
